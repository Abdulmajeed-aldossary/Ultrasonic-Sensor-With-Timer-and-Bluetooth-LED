# Ultrasonic-Sensor-With-Timer-and-Bluetooth

In this circuit, the ultrasonic sensor will measure the distance from the robot to a person. If the person stands for three seconds or more, the display will show "Completed," and an LED will be turned on (replacing the Bluetooth signal sent to display a video). Also, the robot arms will start moving.
